# üö¶Traffic Light System
<b>
A simple embedded system using PIC16F877A simulates a traffic light system between two streets. The system has two modes:

### <ins>Automatic Mode:</ins>
  - West St. (15s Red, 3s Yellow, 20s Green).
  - South St. (23s Red, 3s Yellow, 12s Green).
 
### <ins>Manual Mode:</ins>
  - The yellow LED is ON for 3 seconds, then the streets are switched. 

## üöÄ Key Features
&nbsp;&nbsp;1Ô∏è‚É£ BCD to 7-segment decoders (7448) for Units and Tens. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2Ô∏è‚É£ Enable pins to activate and deactivate the 7-segments. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3Ô∏è‚É£ Using RB0 interrupt with the Auto/Manual button. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4Ô∏è‚É£ Dependency of Auto/Manual switching on the previous mode condition.
